/**
 * Class library file for statistical methods
 *
 * Obect Oriented Programming (OOP) demonstration using built-in PHP array functions
 *
 * In PHP we typically use explicit getter and setter methods. "Getters" gather and package
 * the information computed by "setter" methods.
 *
 * Extra verbose commenting for usage in future teaching session. Using Wordpress PHP coding standards
 * from @link https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/
 * and @link https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/
 * 
 * Class, method, and property naming conventions aligned with WordPress standards via @link
 * https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/#naming-conventions
 *
 *	Usage:
 *		1. Instantiate new object while simultaneously intitializing $array_from_client, $submission_type:
 *			$statistics_object = new Statistics( $array_of_numbers['numbers'], 'API' );
 *
 *		2. Send object to the method (getter function) get_all_statistics() and store output in an array
 *			$server_response['result'] = $statistics_object->get_all_statistics();

	 * Setter to compute median
	 * 
	 *  How to compute:
	 * 
	 *  1. Array most be sorted first
	 *  2. Goal is find position (i.e, index) of median
	 * 	3. Assume 0-indexed array structure. Therefore:
	 *  	a. If array size (n) is odd: Median is at index (n-1)/2 
	 * 		   NB: subtract 1 to make 0-indexed positioning
	 *  	b. If array size (n) is even (ie., n % 2 == 0): Two elements in the middle are medians at indexes 
	 * 	       floor((n-1)/2) and at n/2
	 * 
	 * Tutrials on computing median:
	 * 
	 * See section called "Searching for the Median":  @link http://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/finding-the-median-of-two-sorted-arrays/240169222
	 * Code Examples in popular languages: @link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-mean-and-median-of-an-unsorted-array/
	 * This example will yield incorrect results b/c lack of sort: @link https://gist.github.com/ischenkodv/262906
