/**
 * Basic math class to extends Statistics classby perforing rudimentry math operations
 *
 * This class example demontrates PHP inheritance. It should however be a parent class!
 * 
 *  1. Override parent methods by declaring the same method in thee child class
 *  
 *  2. To access the parent class version of the method, use the scope resolution operaator
 * 
 * To add new functionality to an inherited method while keeping the original method intact, 
 * use the parent keyword with the scope resolution operator (::)
 *      
 *  Specifically: name the class where you want PHP to search for a method: 
 *      Statistics::get_mode( $array_numbers );
 *      
 *  Shortcut: if you just want refer to current classâ€™s parent use the 'parent' keyword 
 *      parent:get_mode( $array_numbers );
 *
